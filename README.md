Base code is at https://github.com/hyperplane-lab/Generative-3D-Part-Assembly

What we should do for Q2
- 

1.) Put their code into /src/{their repo} 
    
Delete their .git file and check it into our repo

2.) Get their pretrained model / dataset

3.) Run their experiments (B-LSTM, B-Global, and their real one)

B-Complement would be cool, but might be hard to do

4.) Put any custom code in /src/ outside of their folder so we can separate their code from ours.
